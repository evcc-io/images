# evcc Linux Images for Raspberry Pi and other SBCs

[![Built with Depot](https://depot.dev/badges/built-with-depot.svg)](https://depot.dev/?utm_source=evcc)

> **üì¶ Beta Release**  
> These images are working well but we're still in beta. Please [report any issues](https://github.com/evcc-io/images/issues) to help us reach stable.

Repository for ready-to-use Debian-based [evcc](https://evcc.io) images for popular single-board computers like Raspberry Pi and NanoPi.

## Image contents

- ‚òÄÔ∏èüöó [evcc](https://evcc.io) for smart energy management
- üîí [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) reverse proxy for HTTPS
- üõ†Ô∏è [Cockpit](https://cockpit-project.org) web console for administration
- üì∂ [comitup](https://github.com/davesteele/comitup) for WiFi setup without ethernet
- üêß [Armbian](https://www.armbian.com) base image and build system
- üîê Automatic security updates enabled (Debian security patches)

## Getting Started

1. Download your image file from [releases](https://github.com/evcc-io/images/releases).
2. Flash your image to an SD card using [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) or [USBImager](https://gitlab.com/bztsrc/usbimager).
3. Insert your SD card and connect your device with power and ethernet.
4. Navigate to `https://evcc.local/` in your browser. Accept the self-signed certificate.
5. You should see the evcc web interface.
6. Alternatively: Use the [evcc iOS/Android app](http://github.com/evcc-io/app) to connect to your evcc instance.

## Administration

- Login into the [Cockpit](https://cockpit-project.org) web console on `https://evcc.local:9090/`
  - username `admin`
  - password `admin`
- You'll be prompted to change your password. **Remember the new password.** There is no reset.
- You can see system health, update packages and run terminal commands.
- Alternatively: connect via SSH `ssh admin@evcc.local`

## Hardware Recommendations

### Storage

16GB storage should be enough when only using evcc.
We recommend running your system from eMMC instead of SD card.
**NanoPi boards come with built-in eMMC storage.**
If you decide to run your system directly from SD card, be sure to read [Armbian's recommendations](https://docs.armbian.com/User-Guide_Getting-Started/#armbian-getting-started-guide) first.

### CPU and RAM

All above boards have plenty of CPU and RAM for evcc.
1GB RAM should be enough.
Pick 2GB if you want to be on the safe side.

## Network Recommendations

For reliability we **strongly suggest** using a **wired ethernet connection**.

### Wireless Setup

If a wired setup is not possible this image also includes a wireless onboarding process.
The device will create a WiFi setup hotspot **if no internet connection is detected after 30 seconds of boot**.

1. Power your device
2. Connect to `evcc-setup` network from your phone or laptop
3. Select your WiFi network and enter the password
4. Connect back to your home network
5. Continue with step 4 from [Getting Started](#getting-started)

**Note**: WiFi setup is a one-time process. To reconfigure WiFi at a new location, simply reboot the device and `evcc-setup` will appear again.

For ethernet-only boards like the NanoPi, you can use WiFi USB dongles. The following adapters have been tested successfully:

- EDUP EP-B8508GS
- _add your's here ..._

## Hardware Comparison

CPU performance is not critical for evcc operation as it's not CPU-intensive. These benchmarks are provided for reference and future-proofing considerations.

Benchmark methodology: Results obtained using sysbench with the following commands:
```bash
# CPU Single
sysbench --test=cpu --cpu-max-prime=20000 --num-threads=1 --max-time=200 run
# CPU Multi
sysbench --test=cpu --cpu-max-prime=20000 --num-threads=4 --max-time=200 run
```

## Building Images Locally

You'll need Docker Desktop installed and running.

```bash
# Clone and enter the repository
git clone https://github.com/evcc-io/images.git
cd images

# Build for Raspberry Pi
./build-local.sh --board rpi4b
```

The image will be at `dist/armbian_evcc-local_rpi4b.img.zip`.
