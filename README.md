## Storage recommendations

Running from built-in eMMC is recommended. Radxa E52C and NanoPi R3S come with built-in storage.

If you decide to run your system directly from SD card, be sure to read [Armbian's recommendations](https://docs.armbian.com/User-Guide_Getting-Started/#armbian-getting-started-guide) first.
